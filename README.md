# Cloud Native Data Center (CNDC)

The Cloud Native Data Center (CNDC) is an open-source project that aims to create, deploy and automate a state-of-the-art data center architecture inspired by the best practices of the most referenced cloud environment giants. Its main approach relies on open-source technologies to make it both accessible and fully reproducible.

This project serves as a reliable source for cloud enthusiasts, system engineers, and developers who seek to explore and deploy a modular and automated cloud infrastructure.

CNDC is designed not only for the previous matter but also to dive in a learning journey that helps tackle cloud-native concepts even for beginners, and for advanced skills building, including customizing automation scripts, applying and implementing security best practices, and mostly contributing to the project.
